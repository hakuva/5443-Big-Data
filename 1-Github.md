## Assignment 1 - Github
#### Due: Thursday Aug 28<sup>th</sup> by 5:30

#### Create a Github account. 
- When you create a Github account, you must choose a `username`. 
- This is very important to remember, because you will email it to me in the next part of this assignment.
- Create a repository named `5443-Big-Data-yourname` replace the `yourname` with your first or last name to make it unique.
- Add me: `rugbyprof` as a collaborator to your repository. You can do this in the settings of your repository.

#### Send me an email:

- `To`: terry.griffin@mwsu.edu
- `Subject`: 5443 Big Data - Assignment 1

Every email must have a minimum of two items included:
