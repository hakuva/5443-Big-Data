### What is MongoDB?

> MongoDB (from "humongous") is a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database.

### Document database

`MongoDB` is a document database, which means that instead of storing "rows" in "tables" like a relational database, "documents" are stored in "collections."  Documents are basically `JSON` objects (technically `BSON`). This is to be distinguished from other NoSQL-type databases such as key-value cache and store (e.g. Redis).
